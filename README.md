# Traffic Flow Simulator With IDM & Lane Changing Models

The GitHub folder structure contains two branches: main and shadow-model. Each branch have almost similar structure. To view or run our code for the experiment, make sure you use the main branch.

The experiment for the one-lane IDM model and multi-lane traffic model are shown in the Jupyter Notebook file named 1_line_IDM_final_report.ipynb and /src/Project_6730_final.ipynb, respectively. The src folder contains the code for the multi-lane traffic model. In this folder, the IDM.py file is the modified IDM model we used for this project and the IDM_original.py is the original IDM model. In case users don't have specific packages, we suggest our user use CoLab to run the Jupyter Notebook online. We already provide the package installation command inside the Jupyter Notebook.
