# Traffic Flow Simulator With IDM & Lane Changing Models

The GitHub folder structure contains shadow model implementation. To view or run our code for the experiment, make sure you use the main branch.

The src folder contains the code for the multi-lane traffic model. In this folder, the IDM.py file is the modified IDM model we used for this project and the IDM_original.py is the original IDM model. In case users don't have specific packages, we suggest our user use CoLab to run the Jupyter Notebook online. We already provide the package installation command inside the Jupyter Notebook.
